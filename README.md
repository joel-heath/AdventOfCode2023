# Advent of Code 2023
My C# solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). Trying to one-liner as many as possible.

## Notes
Here you can easily navigate each days code and read about how well I think I did, as well as how close I was to solving it in one line.

### Legend
ðŸŸ¢ Successful one-liner.<br>
ðŸŸ¡ One-liner with up to three functions / class variables<br>
ðŸŸ  Far from a one-liner, with minimal amounts of code reduced.<br>
ðŸ”´ Barely a visible effort to reduce the code. <br>
âš« Unattempted (probably because the problem isn't out yet or I forgot to push).

| **Day** | **Verbosity** | **Notes** |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| [1](AdventOfCode2023/Day01.cs) | ðŸŸ¢ | Suprisingly complicated day one, involving the English numerals that overlap for part two. Simplest solution to part two is to replace `one` with `one1one` (etc.) to preserve overlapping lines. |
| [2](AdventOfCode2023/Day02.cs) | ðŸŸ¢ | This one I went straight for regex, but the easier solution was splitting. I've got one-liners but they're complicated ones today, making good use of `GroupBy()` |
| [3](AdventOfCode2023/Day03.cs) | ðŸŸ¢ | Today's is a difficult one to reduce to one line as you need to search around a point, re-indexing the input. A simple solution is containerizing the input and iterating over that one-item collection. The input can then be parsed and then starting a new Select will allow the parsed input to be referenced. All thats needed at the end is a `.First()` |
| [4](AdventOfCode2023/Day04.cs) | ðŸŸ¢ | Part one is an easy one-liner, but part two is another one that in theory requires re-indexing, but using an aggregate to carry along an array while calculating the total allows it to be done. I'm not sure the one-liners will last much longer... |
| [5](AdventOfCode2023/Day05.cs) | ðŸŸ  | I got part one down to one line but part two is proving very difficult, due to one range being mapped to many ranges, which each could be mapped to more a procedural approach is a queue and a function is recursive, neither of which can be done in one line. Besides, my recursive solution doesn't work. This may be the end of the line for the one-liners. |

# Advent of Code 2023
My C# solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023). Trying to one-liner as many as possible.

## Notes
Here you can easily navigate each days code and read about how well I think I did, as well as how close I was to solving it in one line.

### Legend
ðŸŸ¢ Successful one-liner.<br>
ðŸŸ¡ Could be reduced to one-liner but would require repeated evaluations of the same code.<br>
ðŸŸ  Far from a one-liner, with minimal amounts of code reduced.<br>
ðŸ”´ Barely a visible effort to reduce the code. <br>
âš« Unattempted (probably because the problem isn't out yet or I forgot to push).

|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| [1](AdventOfCode2023/Day01.cs) | ðŸŸ¡ | Suprisingly complicated day one, involving the english numerals for part two. I solved part two by reading the input forwards and getting the first numeral, then reading it in reverse and getting the first reversed numeral. |
